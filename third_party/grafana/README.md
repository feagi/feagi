# **Visualizing FEAGI data with Grafana**
Users have the option of performing real-time monitoring of artificial brain activities (ex: membrane potentials, active cortical areas, composite network activity, current burst index etc.) during FEAGI execution, which can be useful for troubleshooting and/or gaining insights into artificial brain functioning. This is achieved using [Grafana](https://grafana.com) combined with [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) serving as a datasource for the various forms of time series data generated by FEAGI. These tools/services can be quickly deployed with FEAGI using a containerized approach with minimal setup required. 

## **Grafana**



## **InfluxDB**
As mentioned above, InfluxDB is used as a Grafana datasource, serving time series data collected during FEAGI execution. Configuration of the InfluxDB datasource for use with Grafana is done using the `datasources.yml` file found in `/feagi-core/third_party/grafana/provisioning/datasources`. **NOTE:** This deployment uses InfluxDB version 2, which relies on the functional data scripting language [Flux](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/get-started/) for querying and other data processing operations instead of the SQL-like [InfluxQL](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/) associated with earlier versions of InfluxDB. In this use case, InfluxDB is serving as middleware by receiving data from FEAGI and making it available to Grafana via Flux queries

**Sample Flux query**
```
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
  |> range(start: -1d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "example-measurement")
  |> mean()
  |> yield(name: "_results")
```

## **Deploying networked FEAGI, InfluxDB and Grafana containers using `docker-compose`**
To deploy a containerized setup consisting of FEAGI, InfluxDB and Grafana, navigate to `/feagi-core/docker/` and enter the following commands as shown below:

**Build the containers**
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose-feagi-influx-grafana.yml build --no-cache`

**Start the containers**
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose-feagi-influx-grafana.yml up`

**Access Grafana**
- navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Grafana main menu, where users may select an existing data visualization dashboard (ex: `test_dashbboard` - a simple, one-panel dashboard for visualizing FEAGI neuron burst data to verify connectivity) or create a new, customized dashboard by clicking on the dashboard icon, then `Manage`, followed by `New Dashboard`.
