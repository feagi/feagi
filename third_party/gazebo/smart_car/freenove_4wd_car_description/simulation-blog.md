Why we start to use Ros2 Foxy and igntion Citadel. I will start with the ROS2 first then There are multiple of reason. The number one reason is real-time data. FEAGI is relying on the real-time data heavily. 

So, ROS2 is compatible with safety industrial applications. Not only that, ROS1 is approaching to the end of life which is in 2025. ROS2 is the newest plus FEAGI is purely made by python3 which ROS2 is also relying on python3. ROS have the unique feature called QoS where you can reduce or increase the data output. ROS1 doesn't have it. 

As for the Igition Citadel, we picked Citadel due to length of support by the gazebo team. Gazebo 11 is also approaching to the end of life which is also in 2025. Igntion Citadel is designed for ROS2 in general as well. Igntion isn't same as classic gazebo11.

Ros2 FOXY, and Igntion Citadel are very good with resources and fit FEAGI's needs. 

The conversion between ignition and ros2 is pretty straightforward and fairly simple which is a huge advantage for us. There's a multiple conversions to intergate the programs. This is a perfect case for any company who want to make their stuff compatible with FEAGI in future.
