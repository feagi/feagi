# FEAGI Community Genome Repository

Welcome to the **FEAGI Community Genome Repository**! We invite all FEAGI community members to contribute their functional genomes to this folder. As the collection of community genomes grows, the organization of this folder will evolve accordingly. For now, please ensure that each genome submission is stored in a dedicated folder. 

### Submission Guidelines:
- **Title & Description**: Each submission should include a clearly defined title and a detailed description that reflects the functionality of the genome.
- **README**: It’s highly encouraged to include a `README.md` file in markdown format, outlining the purpose and features of the genome.
  
### Example Folder Structure:
```plaintext
community_genomes/
  ├── genome_name/
  │   ├── genome.json
  │   ├── README.md
  │   └── supplementary_files/
```


### Contribution Process:
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. Add your genome folder and related files.
4. **Commit** your changes and push them to your fork.
5. Submit a **Pull Request** to this repository for review.

### Genome Validation
Please ensure your genome is functional before submitting it to the repository. If you are uncertain, refer to the [FEAGI documentation](https://github.com/feagi/feagi/wiki) for testing instructions.

### Licensing
