# Overview
This genome is based on the Essential Genome created by Nadji, with additional features for basic collision avoidance behavior. It provides fundamental neural circuitry for a FEAGI-powered robot or virtual agent.
# Additions
* Collision Avoidance Circuit
  * Dedicated cortical area that maps proximity data to backward motion
  * Helps prevent collisions by triggering retreat behavior
  * Integrates with existing motor control systems
  * Configurable sensitivity and response parameters
