# Genome for Webots salamander

This genome is for the salamandar premade robot in Webots. This genome makes the salamadar walk foreward until it reaches an obstacle ahead based on the position sensor data. When getting close to an object, it will turn and walk in another direction with the goal of not hitting the wall.
