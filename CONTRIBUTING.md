## Coding Standards

All code / changes submitted must be done in good faith and in accordance to the [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) licensing terms.

Python code contributions should adhere to the standards described in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). All Python code contributions should be documented in accordance with [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) conventions. Static code analysis tools like [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) provide configurable, automated solutions for checking and enforcing PEP compliance. The `feagi` [repository](https://github.com/feagi/feagi) continuous integration (CI) workflow uses Pylint to analyze Python code contributions. A CI workflow job will fail if Pylint code analysis results in a code quality score below a defined threshold.

Godot code contributions is done primarily in GDScript, and should follow the styling guide as discussed in [Godot's documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
