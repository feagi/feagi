FEAGI is a brain inspired evolutionary framework capable of growing an artificial brain from a
genome and helping it evolve over generations.

This main module is responsible for driving the lifecycle of a single generation of an
artificial brain at a time. To scale up the system to many parallel generations, FEAGI
is intended to run within a container and scale up to many container instances.
