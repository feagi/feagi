OPU Design and Implementation

Placeholder to document the general approach to design and implement an OPU




**OPU Controller design**


**OPU Destination design**


**OPU processor design**



**OPU cortical structure design**

A dedicated cortical structure is needed to be created for each property of each output object class. As an example for controlling the speed and power of a set of 4 unique motors we will need to have 2 distinct cortical structures: one to control the speed of the motors and the other to control the power. The Z dimension of the cortical area will be used to capture the variables on the given parameter for the output object and the X dimension to be used to address different motors in the given set.
