    This function creates a mapping between neurons from a motor cortex region to values suitable for motor operation -
    such as direction, speed, duration, and power.

    Speed is captured by a value between 0 to 100 or 0 to -100 where negative values reflect opposite rotation
    Power is captured by a value between 0 to 100
    Duration will be derived based on the number of times this function is called. Spike train from the brain will -
    trigger multiple calls to this function which in return will generate incremental movements on the motor.

    Motor Cortex Assumptions:
    - Each motor, actuator, servo, or an artificial muscle would have a designated cortical column assigned to it
    - Each motor cortex cortical column will be recognized with its geometrical dimensions as well as block counts in -
    x, y, and z direction
    - X direction captures the motor_id.
    - Y direction does not have any operational significance and cortical columns of the motor cortex are to be created-
    with 1 block in x direction
    - Z direction reflects SPEED. Neurons above the mid-point of Y axis will reflect positive speed and below will -
    reflect negative speeds. The further the neuron is from the center point of y access the faster the speed
