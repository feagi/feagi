## Ros2 on FEAGI
This is to test the sample on FEAGI. You will learn that FEAGI will react to sonar sensor. Once sonar sensor is stopped, you can see FEAGI stopped as well too. The purpose of this document is to learn how to use FEAGI through ROS. This document can be done using Micro-ROS or py2arduino.

# Test with FEAGI
1. Follow the document from [this](https://github.com/feagi/feagi-core/blob/develop/DEPLOY.md)
2. Once you have FEAGI running, open a new terminal
